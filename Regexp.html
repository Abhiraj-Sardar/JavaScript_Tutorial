//         Let us look at how JavaScript allows Regular Expressions:

// Regular Expression Modifiers : Modifiers can be used to perform multiline searches. Some of the pattern modifiers that are allowed in JavaScript:

// Modifiers	Description
// [abc]	Find any of the character inside the brackets
// [0-9]	Find any of the digits between the brackets 0 to 9
// (x/y)	Find any of the alternatives between x or y separated with |
// Regular Expression Patterns :Metacharacters are characters with a special meaning. Some of the metacharacters that are allowed in JavaScript:

// Metacharacters	Description
// .	Used for finding a single character, except newline or line terminator
// \d	Used to find a digit.
// \s	Used to find a whitespace character
// \uxxxx	Used to find the Unicode character specified by the hexadecimal number
// Quantifiers define quantities. They provide the minimum number of instances of a character, group, or character class in the input required to find a match. Some of the quantifiers allowed in JavaScript are:

// Quantifiers	Description
// n+	Used to match any string that contains at least one n
// n*	Used to match any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n
// n?	Used to matches any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n
// n{x}	Matches strings that contain a sequence of X nâ€™s
// ^n	Matches strings with n in the first place
// Here is an example to help you understand regular expression better.

// You can also use regEx() to create regular expression in javascript:

// A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. The search pattern can be used for text search and text to replace operations. A regular expression can be a single character or a more complicated pattern.

// Syntax: /pattern/modifiers;
// const regex1 = /^ab/;
// const regex2 = new Regexp('/^ab/');
        // Program to validate the email address 
        function validateEmail(email) { 

        // Regex pattern for email 
        const re = /\S@\S+\.+\S/g; 

        // Check if the email is valid 
        let result = re.test(email); 

        if (result) { 
            console.log("The email is valid."); 
        } else { 
            console.log("The email is not valid."); 
        } 
        } 

        // Input Email Id 
        let email = "abc@gmail.com"
        validateEmail(email); //The email is valid.

        email = "abc#$#@45com"
        validateEmail(email); //The email is not valid.
